## This is an example GitHub Repository for an R Project

I'll be demo-ing this at the SSC Virtual Skills Workshop in February!

You can "fork" this to make a copy on your own account that you can push and pull to.

I can even edit the README on GitHub directly (but I'll need to pull in the changes to my R Project locally)!
